Notes:
  - This note only occurs on the Windows Server rhub environment, and from what I have seen about these types of notes they do not occur when building and checking on CRAN.

You can also see the results of R CMD check on Windows, Linux, and MacOS by going to the GitHub Actions run labeled `check-deploy` [here](https://github.com/hugheylab/pmparser/actions).
